This is a forked repository from themattharris tmhOAuth library. 
This fork doesn't actually constitute its own distinct fork, this fork is only utilizing the tmhOAuth library.
Most of the codes in this repository is adapted from Adam Green's ebook, which can be found here: 140dev.com.
I renamed the original "README" to "README from tmhOAuth".

### What this repository does
Aiding you to produce batch of numbered tweets. That may seems useless. But sometimes it can be handy when the time comes. 
Anyway I do this just because I think it's fun.

### How it works
1) Simply download all the files. 2) Edit post_tweet_batch.php to match your need. 
3) Upload to your server, preferebly a localhost, since the codes are quite resource-hungry.
4) Please visit dar.web.id for further explanations.

### Closing
I'm sorry if I ever did wrong since I'm a total newbie in github. Reach me on twitter @dmwsdq if you ever need to. 
That's where you'll find me easier.
